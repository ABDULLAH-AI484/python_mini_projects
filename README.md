## Hostel rent calulation
I live in a hostel with my roommate, and we struggle to evenly split the monthly rent. Therefore, I plan to create a front-end tool to calculate the rent.
The Hostel Rent Calculation project is a web application built using Flask and HTML/CSS that calculates and displays the electricity bill and rent distribution for hostel residents. Users input details such as units consumed, rate per unit, fixed charges, tax rate, hostel rent, food bill, and total persons. The app calculates the total electricity bill (including sub-parts like cost, tax, etc.) and divides the total expenses (electricity + hostel rent + food) equally among all residents. The result is displayed in a clean, user-friendly interface with a highlighted section showing the amount each person needs to pay

## Tic-tac-toe game
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It features a responsive and stylish design with interactive gameplay, including dynamic winning line animations when a player wins. Players can enjoy a modern, colorful interface with hover effects and easily reset the game to play again. The game is simple to run locally using Flask and provides a fun and engaging experience in the browser.
